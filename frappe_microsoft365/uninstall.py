"""Leave a site in a working state, with nothing left behind, when this app is removed.

Frappe's own uninstall deletes the app's DocTypes and module, but not custom fields added to
standard DocTypes (Event, File) or their columns, and it knows nothing about attachments that
were moved to SharePoint, whose links point at this app. This runs first and handles both:

1. Attachments that live in SharePoint are dealt with as the site chose in Microsoft Settings >
   *If this app is uninstalled* (or ``microsoft365_uninstall_files`` in site_config.json:
   ``restore`` / ``leave``):

   * **Bring files back to this server**: each is downloaded back and its File row pointed at it
     again. The free disk space is checked first, because bringing years of attachments home is
     exactly what can fill a hosted server; if it would not fit, nothing is downloaded.
   * **Leave files in SharePoint**: nothing is downloaded; each attachment becomes a link to its
     SharePoint copy, which opens for people with access to the site.
   * No choice made: asked in a terminal, otherwise the uninstall stops and says where to choose.

   Either way, if any file cannot be handled the uninstall stops and lists them, so no attachment
   is ever left pointing at an app that is gone. SharePoint copies are never deleted.
2. Every custom field this app added is deleted, and its column dropped.
3. Cached tokens and settings are cleared.

Frappe calls before_uninstall during ``--dry-run`` too, so a dry run only reports what would happen.
