"""Microsoft connection doctor.

Connecting Frappe to Microsoft 365 fails in a dozen ways that all surface as the same
unhelpful string — ``AUTHENTICATE failed``, ``535 5.7.3``, ``invalid_grant`` — with no
indication which of the fifteen setup steps was wrong. This module inspects the
configuration and says what is actually wrong, in the admin's language.

It only ever READS configuration. It does not touch mail sending or receiving, the Email
Account doctype's behaviour, or the email queue: Frappe's own IMAP/SMTP + OAuth path stays
exactly as it is, and several mailboxes keep working the way they always did.

Every rule below is derived from a documented requirement, cited inline:

* Microsoft, "Authenticate an IMAP, POP or SMTP connection using OAuth"
  https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/exchange/client-developer/legacy-protocols/how-to-authenticate-an-imap-pop-smtp-application-by-using-oauth
* Microsoft Entra authentication error codes
  https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity-platform/reference-error-codes
* Microsoft, "Manage transcript API access for Teams meetings" (the 2026 tenant switch)
  https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/meeting-transcript-api-access
* Microsoft, "Manage Teams recording policies for meetings and events"
  https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/meeting-recording
* Microsoft, "Limits and specifications for Microsoft Teams" (meeting expiration)
  https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/limits-specifications-teams#meeting-expiration

Some of the setup cannot be checked from here at all — a tenant switch with no Graph API
behind it, a consent grant we only ever see the shadow of, a licence. Those live in
``manual_setup_steps`` and are reported as notes, never as faults.

The check functions take plain dicts rather than Documents so they stay pure and fully
testable offline. ``run_diagnostics`` is the thin layer that loads real records into them.

	* A licence, and whether anyone pressed record, are facts about the tenant and the meeting,
