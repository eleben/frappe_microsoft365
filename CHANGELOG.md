# Changelog

## Unreleased — SharePoint document storage

### Added

- **Document Storage**: a *SharePoint Mapping* per DocType points it at a SharePoint site,
  library and base folder (a Teams channel's Files tab is just that), with its own Test, Site
  Grant Script and Move Existing Attachments; the global switch and options live in Microsoft
  Settings.
- **Automatic or On demand** per mapping: on demand, a record's files move only once someone
  creates its folder (from the record, or a SharePoint Folder); a SharePoint Folder can
  also link a folder that already exists in SharePoint. Each record gets its own folder; new
  attachments are moved there by a background job and keep opening from the form, and the copy
  on disk is removed unless *Keep a local copy* is ticked. Large files go through resumable
  upload sessions. Failed moves are marked on the File and retried hourly.
- **Files in Microsoft 365** panel on mapped forms: the folder's contents, including files added
  from Teams or SharePoint, opened through Frappe with the record's own read permission.
- **App-only Graph calls**: `graph_request(..., microsoft_graph.APP_ONLY)` uses the client
  credentials flow, with the token cached encrypted per site. Document storage needs the
  `Sites.Selected` application permission and a per-site grant — never tenant-wide
  `Sites.ReadWrite.All`.
- Doctor: Document Storage checks, a *Test SharePoint Connection* that proves write access per
  mapping, and a *SharePoint Site Grant Script* that grants the app only the mapped sites.
- *Move Existing Attachments* queues files attached before a DocType was mapped. Optional
  archiving of linked attachments, SSRF-guarded to public addresses.

Nothing is deleted from SharePoint unless *Remove from SharePoint when the attachment is
deleted* is ticked, and then only to the site recycle bin. Deleting a record keeps its folder.

## Unreleased — modular setup

### Added

- **Capability selection** in Microsoft Settings: calendar, mail and sign-in are independent
  and individually optional. The doctor only checks what you selected, so it never nags about
  mail or sign-in you never wanted.
- **Set Up** builds what each selected capability needs from the single Azure registration
  already configured — a `Connected App` for mail, a `Social Login Key` for sign-in — with a
  plan shown first. It only ever creates missing records: anything that exists is reported
  with its drift and left untouched, and a second run does nothing.
- Sign-in is provisioned with tenant-specific **v2.0** endpoints, because Frappe's built-in
  Office 365 provider defaults to `/common/` and v1.0, which a single-tenant app rejects.
- New doctor rules for the `Social Login Key` (`/common/` authority, v1.0 endpoints, client-id
  mismatch, sign-in switched off) and a notice giving the exact second redirect URI Azure needs.
- **Check Microsoft Setup** button on `Email Account`, so one account can be diagnosed from
  the form where the failure appears.

Still read-only with respect to mail: no Graph mail, no replacement for `Email Account`, no
changes to the email queue.

## Unreleased — connection doctor

### Added

- **Microsoft connection doctor** (`Microsoft Settings` → Troubleshoot): inspects Microsoft
  Settings, the Connected App and every Email Account and reports what is wrong, instead of
  leaving admins with `AUTHENTICATE failed`. Rules cover scope/flow mismatches, the missing
  `offline_access` scope (the cause of "it works for an hour then stops"), v1.0 endpoints,
  tenant and redirect-URI drift, IMAP folders, TLS flag combinations, and the shared-mailbox
  identity conflict where Microsoft wants different identities for IMAP and SMTP.
- **Error explainer** mapping Microsoft/IMAP/SMTP failures (AADSTS codes, `535 5.7.3`,
  `451 4.7.0`, `invalid_grant`, `AUTHENTICATE failed`, TLS) to a cause and a next step.
- **Exchange setup script generator** for app-only mailbox access, which looks the service
  principal up by AppId rather than asking for an Object ID — Microsoft documents that using
  the App Registration one instead of the Enterprise Application one fails silently.
- 34 tests, all offline: every rule runs against plain config dicts, no tenant or network.

The doctor is read-only. It does not send or receive mail, replace `Email Account`, or touch
the email queue; Frappe's own IMAP/SMTP + OAuth path is untouched.

## Unreleased — sync correctness

The calendar sync engine was reworked around Graph delta queries. If you are upgrading an
existing install, run `bench --site <site> migrate`; the first sync after the upgrade
re-initialises the delta window automatically.

### Fixed

- **Pushed events stopped syncing after the first pull.** The pull flagged every event it
  touched as "pulled from Microsoft", including ones Frappe had just pushed, and the doc-event
  handler skips flagged events. Later local edits were silently dropped. Origin is now
  permanent.
- **The pull overwrote local descriptions** with Graph's truncated plain-text `bodyPreview`.
  Descriptions of Frappe-originated events are no longer touched.
- **A failed pull advanced the watermark**, so every change inside the failed window was lost
  forever. The watermark now moves only after a complete, successful read, and the failure is
  recorded in the new `last_error` field.
- **No pagination.** Reads were capped at the first page (`$top=50` / `$top=100`), so large
  calendars imported partially and reported success. All collection reads now follow
  `@odata.nextLink` to the end.
- **Recurring events were duplicated.** The first sync used `calendarView` (occurrences) and
  later syncs used `/me/events` (series masters) — two different id spaces. Both now use
  `calendarView/delta`, and series masters are skipped.
- **Deleted Microsoft events orphaned their Frappe mirror.** Delta `@removed` entries are now
  processed, alongside the existing `isCancelled` handling.
- **Windows timezone names silently became UTC**, moving meetings by hours. Graph is asked for
  UTC and Windows ids are mapped to IANA, with an Error Log entry for anything unrecognised.
- **Overlapping scheduled syncs.** Each calendar now syncs under a per-calendar file lock.
- **`429` was raised, not handled.** Short `Retry-After` waits are honoured with one retry;
  longer ones are deferred to the next run. `410` now triggers an automatic full re-sync.
- **Push was create-only.** Events edited while the connection was down are patched on the next
  sync instead of drifting forever.
- **`Microsoft Calendar` was readable/writable by the `All` role**, which includes Website
  Users. Replaced with `Desk User`, matching Frappe's Google Calendar.
- Pointless saves during the pull bumped `modified` on unchanged events, which made the push
  step patch them back to Graph on every run.

### Added

- `graph_paged()` and `graph_delta()` helpers in `microsoft_graph`.
- `last_error`, `delta_window_end` and `oauth_state_expiry` fields on `Microsoft Calendar`;
  authorize links now expire after 15 minutes.
- Event `location` is synced in both directions.
- 31 tests covering the sync engine and Graph transport with mocked Graph responses.
- CI runs a Frappe `version-15` + `version-16` matrix.

### Removed

- The unused `authorization_code` field on `Microsoft Calendar`.
